          While all the   while<br>
          the Captain watched for news<br>
          And in the schoolhouse,<br>
          they played   us records<br>
          Don't be afraid, children just dance...</h4>
        <h4 align="left">AND I WAS DANCING<br>
          AND YOU WERE DANCING<br>
          WITH TEARS IN OUR   EYES<br>
          WITH TEARS IN OUR EYES.</h4>
        <h4 align="left">Behind the station the men were working<br>
          It was now dark, no   massage from the tent<br>
          One hundred families, no place but maybe<br>
          Mothers   just said, don't be afraid...</h4>
        <h4 align="left">And then the sound came,<br>
          and just one last time<br>
          Mothers did   say<br>
          don't be afraid,<br>
          children, just dance...</h4>
