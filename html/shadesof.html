        <h4 align="left">Took a trip to New York<br>
          Drove there right on the highway<br>
          I got there the same day<br>
          Thought I'd hang out on Broadway</h4>
        <h4 align="left">I parked my car, started to walk<br>
          But when I reached the next block</h4>
        <h4 align="left">Everything was turning green<br>
          SHADES OF GREEN<br>
          SHADES OF GREEN</h4>
        <h4 align="left">Checked into a hotel <br>
          Thought I'd just read the paper<br>
          Flipped to page thirty four<br>
          It was some local caper</h4>
        <h4 align="left">I thought I heard knocks at my door<br>
          But when I listened some more</h4>
        <h4 align="left">Everything strted turning green<br>
          SHADES OF GREEN<br>
          SHADES OF GREEN</h4>
        <h4 align="left">They say when the changes begin<br>
          Things won't say like they've been<br>
          Everything starts turning green...</h4>
        <h4 align="left">It was a girl at the door<br>
          She said this heat made her worry<br>
          If we still wanted to ski<br>
          She said thet we had to hurry<br>
          We drove to the hills leased a lift<br>
          But at the top we'd been gypped</h4>
