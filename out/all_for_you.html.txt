                A lot of dreams
                  A lot of love
                  And it's all for you
                La, da, da, da,
                  La, da, da, da,
                  Yes, it's all for you.
                I know I'm young, I've got a lot to live
                  Friends see little I can't do
                  But thought I,ve got a whole lot left to give
                  I want to give it all to you.
                A lot of hope
                  A lot of life
                  And it's all for you
                La, da, da, da,
                  La, da, da, da,
                  Yes, it's all for you.
                In their frantic search for plesure
                  Friends will think I've wasted mine
                  When they've finally found thew tresure
                  They'll see we had it all the time.
                A lot of dreams
                  A lot of love
                  And it's all for you
                La, da, da, da,
                  La, da, da, da,
                  Yes, it's all for you.
                  La, da, da, da,
                  La, da, da, da,
                  Yes, it's all for you.
