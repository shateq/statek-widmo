The HAPPY SONG
        (K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
        
          At twelve o'clock on Sunday
            Why don't we go for a ride?
            We   can go out to the country
            Make ourselves, feel good inside
          With all your friends beside you
            Life just gets more fun each   day
            If you like us, don't be shy now
            We all hope that you can stay
          This little song is simple
            But it's kind of fun to sing
            You   sing and it make you happy
            And it doesn't cost a thing
          Whether you're young or you're old now
            Snow or rain or wind or   shine
            If it seems to make you happy
            Sing this song and you'll feel   fine
          If it seems to make you happy 
            Sing this song and you'll feel   fine
            Happy song make you feel fine
            Happy song make you feel   fine!
