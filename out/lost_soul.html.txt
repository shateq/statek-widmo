LOST SOUL
        (K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
        She could be so nice,
          She could be so good
          She would be   heaven
          If she only could
        SHE'S JUST A LOST SOUL
          BUT I LOVE HER
          ONE DAY   SHE'LL
          FIND HER WAY AGAIN
          AND I SHALL RETURN
        Was it all her fault?
          Was it her mistake?
          When they all   made her 
          Out to be a fake
        SHE'S JUST A LOST SOUL
          BUT I LOVE HER
          ONE DAY   SHE'LL
          FIND HER WAY AGAIN 
          AND I SHALL COME HOME
