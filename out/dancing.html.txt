DANCING
      (K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
        Out in the distance we heard the cannons
          While all the   while
          the Captain watched for news
          And in the schoolhouse,
          they played   us records
          Don't be afraid, children just dance...
        AND I WAS DANCING
          AND YOU WERE DANCING
          WITH TEARS IN OUR   EYES
          WITH TEARS IN OUR EYES.
        Behind the station the men were working
          It was now dark, no   massage from the tent
          One hundred families, no place but maybe
          Mothers   just said, don't be afraid...
        And then the sound came,
          and just one last time
          Mothers did   say
          don't be afraid,
          children, just dance...
