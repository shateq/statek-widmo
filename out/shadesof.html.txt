SHADES OF GREEN
(K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
        Took a trip to New York
          Drove there right on the highway
          I got there the same day
          Thought I'd hang out on Broadway
        I parked my car, started to walk
          But when I reached the next block
        Everything was turning green
          SHADES OF GREEN
          SHADES OF GREEN
        Checked into a hotel 
          Thought I'd just read the paper
          Flipped to page thirty four
          It was some local caper
        I thought I heard knocks at my door
          But when I listened some more
        Everything strted turning green
          SHADES OF GREEN
          SHADES OF GREEN
        They say when the changes begin
          Things won't say like they've been
          Everything starts turning green...
        It was a girl at the door
          She said this heat made her worry
          If we still wanted to ski
          She said thet we had to hurry
          We drove to the hills leased a lift
          But at the top we'd been gypped
        Everything was turning green
          SHADES OF GREEN
