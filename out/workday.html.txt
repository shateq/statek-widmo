Workday
        (K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
        Got to make the train, got to get ready
          One more cup of coffee to get steady
          Secretaries type
          And windshield wipers wipe
          Let's get to work!
        People in the center of the dry
          First impressions count so they look pretty
          Going up and down
          Running all around
          Let's get to work!
        IT'S ANOTHER WORKDAY!
          JUST A 9 TO 5 DAY
          JUST ANOTHER WORKDAY!
          IT'S A MAKE YOUR BREAD DAY
          GOT TO GET AHEAD DAY
          JUST ANOTHER WORKDAY!
        Here's a project that needs to be ready
          Only way to do it is work steady
          If you don't know how
          You'd better learn right now
          Let's get to work!
        The girls were showingo off
          their fashion flash
          The boys were yakking
          'bout the weekend bash
          Then the boss came in
          And yelled right through the din
          Let's get to work
