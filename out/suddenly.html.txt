Suddenly
        (K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
        SUDDENLY
          You see the real me
          SUDDENLY
          I think I am free
        After all this time
          And searching, you looked and there I was
        So bring out the champagne
          Let's dance the night away
        Yes, SUDDENLY, SUDDENLY, yes.
          You found me!
        SUDDENLY
          I see the real you
          SUDDENLY
          It's like you're brand new
        Searched around the world
          For something that was always at home
        So bring out the champagne
          Let's dance the night away
        Yes, SUDDENLY, SUDDENLY, yes
          I found you
