THE SHOW NEVER ENDS
(K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
        Wake me
          I nthe morning
          Please give me my guitar
          'Cause THE SHOW NEVER ENDS
        Put me
          On the plane
          Got to make the next town
          'Cause THE SHOW NEVER ENDS
        We feel so very very tired
          And there's still
          such a long, long way to go ...
        Get me
          To the people
          Please make sure I'm not late
          'Cause THE SHOW NEVER ENDS
        Tell me
          When to sleep
          Make sure I get rest
          'Cause THE SHOW NEVER ENDS
