          I was doing fine, thanks, yes I was
            Had everything figured out
            When it came to knowing
            what's coming off
            I knew what it was about
          I nen the little lady entered my life
            Said there's a thing i forgot
            And by the time she left
            I knew who was right
            I was missing a whole lot
          THINK I'LL CALL YOU
            TROUBLEMAKER
            YOU CAN'T LET THINGS
            STAY LIKE THEY WERE
            I WAS FINE WITHOUT YOU FOR SURE
            NOW YOU'VE DONE IT
            TROUBLEMAKER!
          Maybe things could kave
            turned out other ways
            Maybe things could have been better
            But as things stand
            I wish I was my old self
            I wish I hadn't a met her
          They say God gives an God takes it away
            But understand, how can I?
            When He takes my
            TROUBLEMAKER away
            Why would He want her to die
