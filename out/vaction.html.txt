VACATION
      (K.Klenczon-V.Beleska)
      
          It's been so long, yes since I got away
            But now my plane leaves today
            I've worked so very hard
            through the whole year
            Now my vacation is here
          Tropical isle in the warm southern seas
            Tropical isle waits for me
            Packing my things just as fast as I can
            You knows I will be there by three
          No more traffic jams
            No more boss
            No more clocks to watch
            Hey my vacation started today!
          Sleep in the morning as long as I want
            Sit on the beach all the day
            And in the evening - the music cafe
            Listen to the natives play
        Basking in the heaven of Shang-gri-La
          This place I'll never forget
          Maybe I'll stay here the rest of my life
          If circumstances will let
